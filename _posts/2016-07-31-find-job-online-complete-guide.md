### How long does it take to find a job online?

Tech professionals often find roles in 2-4 months, while specialized positions may take longer. Consistent daily effort and a strong digital presence can significantly reduce this timeline.

### What's the best job search platform for remote work?

### How many jobs should I apply to per week?

Quality over quantity is key. Apply to 5-10 carefully selected positions weekly rather than mass-applying to 50+ jobs. Customize each application, research the company, and ensure you meet 70%+ of the requirements for better response rates.
